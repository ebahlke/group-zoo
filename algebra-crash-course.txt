1) BASIC BACKGROUND: WHAT IS A GROUP?
A group is a set of elements with a well-defined binary operation (an operation that combines two elements of the set to produce another) that fulfills the following axioms, where * stands for the group operation:

i) Associativity: (a*b)*c = a*(b*c)
ii) Closure: if a and b are in the group, then so is their product a*b
iii) Identity: the group contains an element e such that a*e = e*a = a for every element in the group
iv) Inverses: every element a has an inverse b such that a*b = e (the identity)

One familiar example of a group is the integers under addition. Here, the operation “*” is simply “+”, and the group axioms are easily verified: addition is associative; the sum of two integers is another integer; the integers contain an additive identity “0”, where n + 0 = n for all integers; and for every integer n, the integer -n is its additive inverse.  The groups presented in Group Zoo are slightly more exciting.  Here’s a rundown of their basic properties:

THE INTEGERS MODULO N
Like the integers, the integers mod n form a group under addition. Unlike the integers, though, the integers mod n (or Z mod N) is a finite group, having exactly n elements in the group. In Z mod N, any two integers separated by a multiple of n are considered the same, so, for instance, in Z mod 7, two equals nine. The key characteristics of Z mod N are that any multiple of N can be treated as equivalent to 0 and that the elements of Z mod N are actually equivalence classes, that is, sets of related elements.  Each integer from 0 to n-1 forms the class [0], [1], ..., [n-1] which contains anything separated from 0, 1, etc. by a multiple of n.  (Harking back to Z mod 7, the elements there are [0] (={0, 7, 14, …}), [1] (={1, 8, 15, …}), and so on, up to [6] (={6, 13, 20, …}).)

Thus, addition modulo n involves a kind of reduction at each step. In the integers, we know that 2+3 = 5; in Z mod 4, however, [5] = [1] (since 5÷4 leaves remainder 1, we can “take out” the 4—this is called reducing modulo n), so while 2+3 = 5 in the integers, [2]+[3]=[5]=[1] in Z mod 4.

DIHEDRAL GROUPS
A dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon.  If we treat as functions the rotations/reflections of the polygon that leave it looking the same, we get a group under function composition.  For example, an equilateral triangle has three axes of symmetry around which it can be reflected, or it can be rotated by 0, 120 or 240 degrees, without any visible change.  Dihedral groups are commonly denoted D_n, where n is the number of sides of the polygon.  There are also n reflections and n rotations in every dihedral group, meaning the total number of elements is 2*n.  The smallest dihedral group, D_1, is Abelian (meaning that elements commute, or a*b = b*a for every two elements in the group), but all other dihedral groups are non-Abelian.  Understandably, dihedral groups have applications in fields where symmetry is highly important, such as geometry and chemistry.

SYMMETRIC GROUPS
A permutation is a bijective function on a finite set of objects {1, … n} that swaps one object for another, and the symmetric group is the set of all such functions on the set.  A permutation of n elements will map each element either to itself or to one of the other n-1 elements, but it must be one-to-one (if f(a) = b and f(c) = b, then a = c) and onto (every element in the set is the image of some element under the permutation).  Thus, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2 is not a valid permutation on the set {1, 2, 3}.  A permutation is commonly written in “cycle notation”: a sequence of integers within a set of parentheses, where each integer maps to the one to its right, with the last one mapping to the first.  For instance, if your permutation is (13), then 1 goes to 3 and 3 goes to 1, and it implicitly maps 2 to itself (so f(1) = 3, f(2) = 2, and f(3) = 1).


2) BELLS & WHISTLES: SUBGROUPS? NORMAL SUBGROUPS? FACTOR GROUPS?
SUBGROUPS
A subgroup is a subset of the group where all the group axioms are still upheld under the same group operation.  In a finite group (and all of the groups in Group Zoo are finite), every element generates a subgroup. That is, the sequence n, n*n, n*n*n, ..., continued until we hit the identity, is a subgroup of the group.  Therefore, Group Zoo gives the user the option of using any element in the group to generate and view a subgroup. If the subgroup is normal, we can go even further, but first...

... what is a normal subgroup?
A normal subgroup is a subgroup whose left and right cosets are equal for every element g in the group. Left and right cosets are the subsets of the group produced as follows: the left coset of g (where g is an element in the group) is the set of all elements of the form "operate(g, s)", where s is a member of the subgroup under consideration and we go through the subgroup members in order to generate the coset. The right coset is the set of all elements of this form except the positions of g and the subgroup member are switched – i.e. we multiply (or add, etc.) on the right. If the left and right cosets are equal, note that this does NOT necessarily mean operate(g, s) = operate(s, g), merely that g*s = t*g for some (possibly distinct) s and t in the subgroup. Then the subgroup is normal, and we can use it to form a...

... FACTOR GROUP
A factor group is a group formed from another group and a normal subgroup. The normal subgroup is used to “partition” the initial group into cosets, and these cosets then form a group themselves under multiplication. To find out more, try to discover a normal subgroup in one of the three groups in Group Zoo and use it to create the resulting factor group.
