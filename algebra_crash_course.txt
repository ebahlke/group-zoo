Algebra Crash Course A group is an algebraic object most simply described as follows: it is a set of elements with a well-defined binary operation (i.e. an operation that combines two elements of the set) that fulfills the following axioms, where * stands for the group operation: i) Associativity: (a*b)*c = a*(b*c) ii) Closure: if a and b are in the group, then so is their product a*b iii) Identity: the group contains an element e such that a*e = e*a = a for every element in the group iv) Inverses: every element a has an inverse b such that a*b = e
One familiar example of a group is the integers under addition. Here, the operation “*” is simply “+”, and the group axioms are easily verified: addition is associative; the sum of two integers is another integer; the integers contain an additive identity “0”, where n + 0 = n for all integers; and for every integer n, the integer -n is its additive inverse.

The groups presented in Group Zoo are slightly more exotic. Here’s a rundown of their basic properties:

THE INTEGERS MODULO N
Like the integers, the integers mod n form a group under addition. Unlike the integers, though, the integers mod n (or Z mod N) is a finite group. Its basic property is that any two integers separated by a multiple of n are considered the same, so, for instance, in Z mod 7, two equals nine. Another way of thinking about this is that, if integer m and integer n have the same whole-number remainder when divided by n, they are congruent (the same) mod n, i.e. if n divides a-b, then a is congruent to b mod n. So the elements of Z mod N are actually equivalence classes, that is, sets of related elements: each integer from 0 to n-1 forms the class [0], [1], ..., [n-1] which contains anything separated from 0, 1, etc. by a multiple of n. The heart of Z mod N is that any multiple of N can be treated as equivalent to 0.
Thus, addition modulo n involves a kind of reduction at each step. In the integers, we know that 2+3 = 5; in Z mod 4, however, [5] = [1] (since 5/4 leaves remainder 1, so we can “take out” the 4 -- this is called reducing modulo n), so while 2+3 = 5 in the integers, [2]+[3]=[1] in Z mod 4.

DIHEDRAL GROUPS
A dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon, including rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are commonly denoted D_n, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. This number is also the number of reflections and the number of rotations in the group. The smallest dihedral group, D_1, is Abelian (meaning that elements commute, or a*b = b*a for every two elements in the group), but all other dihedral groups are not. However, each rotations subgroup is Abelian. Every reflection has order two, and the order of each rotation divides the dimension of the group.

SYMMETRIC GROUPS
A permutation group is a set of functions on a finite set of objects that swap one object for another, and the symmetric group is the set of ALL such functions. A permutation of "n" elements will map each element either to itself or one of the other n-1 elements, but a permutation may not map any given element to the same as another, nor may it map a given element to multiple elements. This is a property we call "injectivity"; it means that permutations are "one-to-one." Without this property, the operation—which for permutations is the composition of two permutation functions—is not well-defined. A permutation is written as a sequence of integers within a set of parentheses, and each integer maps to the one to its right, with the last one mapping to the first. Thus if your permutation is (13) it maps the object "1" to "3" and "3" maps to "1", and it maps the implicit third object, "2", to itself.

SUBGROUPS
A subgroup is a subset of the group that fulfills all the group axioms itself. In a finite group (and all of the groups in Group Zoo are finite), every element generates a subgroup. That is, the sequence n, n*n, n*n*n, ..., continued until we hit the identity, is a subgroup of the group (though not all subgroups are necessarily of this form). Therefore, Group Zoo gives the user the option of using any element in the group to generate and view a subgroup. If the subgroup is normal, we can go even further, but first...

... what is a normal subgroup?
A normal subgroup is a subgroup whose left and right cosets are equal for every element g in the Group. Left and right cosets are the subsets of the group produced as follows: the left coset of g (where g is an element in the group) is the set of all elements of the form "operate(g, [some member of the subgroup])". The right coset is the set of all elements of this form except the positions of g and the subgroup member are switched - i.e. we multiply (or add, etc.) on the right. If the left and right cosets are equal, note that this does NOT mean operate(g, s) = operate(s, g), merely that g*s = t*g for some (possibly distinct) s and t in the subgroup. Then the subgroup is normal, and we can use it to form a...

... FACTOR GROUP
A factor group is a group formed from another group and a normal subgroup. The normal subgroup is used to “partition” the initial group into cosets, and these cosets then form a group themselves under multiplication. To find out more, try to discover a normal subgroup in one of the three groups in Group Zoo and use it to create the resulting factor group.
