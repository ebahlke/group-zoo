Named in honour of the creators' abstract algebra professor's favourite group-related metaphor, Group Zoo is a teaching tool and light diversion for math students and fans of algebra.  The download includes a mini abstract algebra app, which allows users to explore a "zoo" containing three specimens of common finite groups, as well as source code for a modest abstract algebra/finite group package in Java.
