Named in honour of the creators' abstract algebra professor's favourite group-related metaphor, Group Zoo is a teaching tool and light diversion for math students and fans of algebra.  The download includes a mini abstract algebra app, which allows users to explore a "zoo" containing three specimens of common finite groups, as well as source code for a modest abstract algebra/finite group package in Java.

The app allows users to create a group of the desired dimension and then operate its elements or find the order/inverse of any element, generate subgroups, and try to find factor groups.  The abstract_alg package contains an abstract class template that can be extended to implement any finite group, with a similar template for the group elements, and complete implementations for the integers modulo n, dihedral groups, symmetric groups, and factor groups.  For users who are unfamiliar with or rusty on abstract algebra, there is an "abstract algebra crash course" (algebra_crash_course.txt) containing basic information on the concepts presented in Group Zoo - what is a group, what are the three groups we're dealing with and how do they work, and so on.
